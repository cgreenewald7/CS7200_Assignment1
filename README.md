Algorithm Design and Analysis
Stable Matching Problem 

This code can be ran through an IDE or through command line. If running through command line, please follow the format as per the assignment requirements: 'file_name input_file' for assignment1.py and 'file_name input_file output_file' for stabilityChecker.py. If no arguements are given for the command line, then the code defaults to run the hard coded input and output files. Please do not try any other form of arguements for the command line, as this code is not writted to handle exceptions as it was not outlined in the requirements. 

If there are any misunderstandings or questions, pease reach out to me by the email provided below.
